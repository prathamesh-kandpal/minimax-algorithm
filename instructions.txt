Take the following response from user:

minimax -v -ab -range n min/max some_tree.txt

where:
v is verbose/normal minimax algorithm mode
ab is alpha beta mode
n is the range of values
min/max means either user is asking to minimize or maximize the root node
some_tree.txt is a txt file that has the values of leaf node which and has some comments with
# before them.

following are all possible combinations:
->minimax -v -range 5 max some-tree.txt
the code will run in verbose mode and the values will range from -5 to 5 and the root node will be maximized and it will take inputs from some-tree.txt
->minimax -v -ab -range 5 max some-tree.txt
the code will use alpha beta pruning and the values will range from -5 to 5 and the root node will be maximized and it will take inputs from some-tree.txt
->minimax -v -range 5 min some-tree.txt
the code will run in verbose mode and the values will range from -5 to 5 and the root node will be minimized and it will take inputs from some-tree.txt
->minimax -v -ab -range 5 min some-tree.txt
the code will use alpha beta pruning and the values will range from -5 to 5 and the root node will be minimized and it will take inputs from some-tree.txt
