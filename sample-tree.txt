#following is an example tree which I have used
#Root node
n
#its childern & leaf nodes
a : [a1,a2]
b : [b1,b2]
c : [c1,c2]
#values of leaf nodes
a1 = -4
a2 = 3
b1 = 5
b2 = 2
c1 = -1
c2 = 8

#if the root node is max, 2 is returned
#if the root node in min, 3 is returned
#Here is the tree structure
